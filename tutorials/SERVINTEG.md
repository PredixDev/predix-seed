# Tutorial : Integrating with a Predix Data Service

## Introduction
Industrial Internet applications will almost always involve collecting data from machines or devices.  Data needs to be presented in visual interfaces for human consumption, which hopefully will lead to insights beneficial for the business and its customers.  Presenting data is often done through visualizations such as charts, graphs and tables.  Lastly, access to such data and its presentation will often need to be gated by authentication.

This tutorial shows how to use the Predix UI Seed to consume machine data generated from a Predix data service, and present it in a chart visualization.  It further shows how to secure access to the chart through authentication with a UAA service.

## Pre-Requisites

#### Node
Node is a server-side application framework written in JavaScript, and is used for the implementation of the server application component of the Seed.  It has a commmand line interface for running applications and managing packages and modules employed therein.  Check the **NodeJS**[https://www.nodejs.org] site for more information.
